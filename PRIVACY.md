# SquadKarma – Privacy / Data Notice (GDPR)

This privacy notice explains how the SquadKarma project processes personal data when you use the service or contribute to its development. The notice follows the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Data Controller
- **Name:** SquadKarma community project
- **Contact point:** privacy@squadkarma.example (to be updated for production)

## Personal Data Processed
- Steam profile data (Steam64ID, display name, avatar URL)
- Service usage logs and audit logs (votes, timestamps, target player, server)
- Moderation and abuse data (e.g., bans, removals, abuse reports)
- Technical metadata: IP address and browser identifiers (for usage monitoring and abuse prevention)

## Purposes and Legal Bases
- **Authentication and access control:** Steam login to create and maintain a user account. *Legal basis:* contract (GDPR 6.1.b).
- **Reputation voting and statistics:** Recording up/down votes, reason categories, and aggregated statistics. *Legal basis:* legitimate interest (GDPR 6.1.f) to maintain community reliability.
- **Spam and abuse prevention:** Enforcing voting limits, using IP addresses for abuse analysis and mitigation. *Legal basis:* legitimate interest (GDPR 6.1.f) and the duty to ensure service security.
- **Moderation and auditing:** Admin panel actions, removals, and ban entries. *Legal basis:* legitimate interest (GDPR 6.1.f) and community safety.

## Retention Periods
- User and vote history: retained while the account is active or up to 24 months after the last login.
- IP addresses and abuse logs: retained for 6–12 months to ensure service security, unless law requires longer retention.
- Audit logs (admin actions): retained for at least 24 months to ensure traceability.

## Recipients and Transfers
- Personal data is not sold or disclosed for commercial purposes.
- Technical service providers (e.g., hosting and database) process data under contract and data processing agreements.
- Data is not transferred outside the EU/EEA without appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses or an equivalent mechanism).

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies
- The service may use strictly necessary cookies to manage sessions and authentication.
- Analytical or marketing cookies are not used without separate consent.

## Automated Decision-Making
- The service does not make automated decisions with significant legal effects. Vote-level limits (e.g., 1 vote per hour) are rule-based, not profiling.

## Data Subject Rights
- **Access:** you can request a copy of your personal data.
- **Rectification:** you can request correction of inaccurate data.
- **Erasure:** you can request deletion when there is no legal basis for processing (e.g., account deletion). Vote logs may be anonymized if aggregate statistics must be retained for community integrity.
- **Restriction and objection:** you can object to processing based on legitimate interest or request restriction; we will assess the request and overriding grounds.
- **Portability:** you can request your data in a structured, machine-readable format where processing is based on a contract and is automated.
- **Withdrawal of consent:** if any processing relies on consent, you may withdraw it at any time.

## Security
- Role-based access control (user/admin), limited access to admin functions, and logging to detect misuse are in place.
- Data is stored on servers protected with up-to-date patches, firewalls, and encrypted transport (HTTPS).

## Changes to This Notice
This notice may be updated. Material changes will be communicated in the service or community channels. Version history is maintained in this file.
