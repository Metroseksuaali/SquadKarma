# Squad Karma - Distributed POC - Project Context for Claude

> This file contains all essential context about the project for Claude assistant.
> **NOTE: This project is pivoting from centralized web-based to distributed POC architecture.**

---

## 📦 GitHub Repository

- **Repo:** https://github.com/Metroseksuaali/SquadKarma
- **Development branch:** `dev` (primary working branch)
- **Production:** `main` (releases only)
- **Local path:** `O:\vibecode\SquadKarma_new`

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Always create a feature branch from dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Then create a Pull Request to dev branch on GitHub
# NEVER push directly to dev or main
```

### Branch Naming
- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/log-parser`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/session-overlap`)
- `docs/` - Documentation (e.g., `docs/poc-spec`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

## 🎯 Project Goal - HYBRID DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE

**Squad Karma** uses a **hybrid distributed, proof-of-presence reputation system** for Squad game players.

### Architecture Model
**Hybrid approach:**
- **ONE central Discord bot** (you maintain) - handles all Discord interactions
- **Multiple distributed nodes** (server operators run) - track sessions and validate votes
- Bot queries node APIs via HTTP to validate votes and check player sessions

### Core Concept: Proof of Presence
Squad server operators run a **node** that:
1. **Parses server logs** to track actual player sessions
2. **Provides HTTP API** for the central bot to query
3. **Validates votes** - only allows votes if both players were present together
4. **Stores sessions/votes locally** in SQLite
5. **Replicates votes** to other trusted nodes (Phase 5)

### Proof of Presence Rules
A vote is ONLY valid if:
- Voter was on the server (session exists)
- Target was on the server (session exists)
- Their sessions **overlapped for ≥5 minutes**
- Vote is within **24 hours** of session ending

### What it's NOT:
- Centralized web service (anymore)
- Purely negative "lynch mob service"
- Free-text based (to prevent harassment)
- Official OWI project

## 🏗️ Hybrid Distributed Architecture

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| **Runtime** | Node.js 20+ | Discord.js compatibility, async I/O |
| **Language** | TypeScript | Type safety, better tooling |
| **Database** | SQLite + Prisma | Local-first, no server setup needed |
| **Discord** | discord.js v14 | Official Discord library |
| **Auth** | Steam OpenID | Link Discord ↔ Steam identity (Phase 3) |
| **API** | Fastify | Fast, low overhead for bot-to-node communication |
| **Log Parsing** | Custom (inspired by SquadJS) | Full control, no dependencies |

## 🔌 Discord Bot Commands

### User Commands (Phase 3+)
```
/help                          # Show available commands and usage guide
/link <steam_profile>          # Link Discord to Steam account (Phase 3)
/vote @user <up|down> <reason> # Vote for player (Phase 4)
/rep <steam_id>                # Check player reputation (Phase 4)
/session [steam64]             # Check session (Phase 3+)
/whoami                        # Show linked Steam account (Phase 3)
```

### Admin Commands (Implemented)
```
/register-node    # Register Squad server node with bot (Administrator only)
/node-status      # Check registered node health and statistics
/unregister-node  # Remove node registration (Phase 3)
```

---

## 🔌 Node HTTP API Endpoints

### Implemented (Phase 2)
```
GET  /api/health                    # Health check (no auth)
GET  /api/stats                     # Node statistics (auth required)
GET  /api/session/:steam64          # Get player session (auth required)
POST /api/session/validate-overlap  # Validate session overlap (auth required)
GET  /api/reputation/:steam64       # Get player reputation (auth required)
```

### Future (Phase 5 - Replication)
```
POST /api/replicate/votes        # Receive votes from other nodes
GET  /api/replicate/health       # Node-to-node health check
```

### Authentication
- Bearer token authentication (API key)
- API keys stored encrypted in bot database
- API keys validated on every request (except /api/health)

---

## 🔐 Business Rules

### Voting Restrictions
1. **Proof of Presence**: Voter and target must have overlapped ≥5 minutes
2. **Time Window**: Vote within 24 hours of session ending
3. **Authentication**: Voter must have linked Discord ↔ Steam account
4. **No Self-Votes**: Cannot vote for yourself
5. **Rate Limit**: Max 10 votes / 10 min per user (anti-spam)

### Session Tracking
- Parsed from Squad server logs (`LogSquad.txt`)
- Join event: Extract Steam64, name, timestamp
- Disconnect event: Update session end time
- Sessions stored in local SQLite database

### Vote Replication
- Votes replicated to trusted peer nodes
- Marked with `replicatedFrom` to prevent duplicates
- Conflict resolution: first vote wins (by timestamp)

## 📝 Coding Conventions

### TypeScript
- Strict mode always enabled
- No `any` types (except temporarily)
- No `I` prefix for interface names
- Enums in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- **All code, comments, commits in ENGLISH** (no Finnish)

### Node.js
- Modular structure (services, Discord, API)
- Service layer for business logic
- Zod for validation
- Graceful error handling

### Git
- Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, docs:...)
- Feature branches from `dev`
- PRs before merging
- **NEVER push directly to dev or main**

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security
- Never store Steam API key in repo
- Validate all Steam64 IDs (17 digits, starts with `7656119`)
- Rate limit Discord commands and API endpoints
- Whitelist trusted nodes for replication
- Use HTTPS for node-to-node communication

### Performance
- SQLite is fast for reads, watch for write contention
- Index steam64 and createdAt columns
- Use Discord embeds for rich formatting
- Cache reputation queries (5 min TTL)

### Log Parsing
- Squad logs format based on [SquadJS](https://github.com/Team-Silver-Sphere/SquadJS)
- Watch for log rotation
- Handle server restarts (sessions left incomplete)
- Parse timestamps in UTC

### Discord Bot
- Use slash commands (not prefix commands)
- Handle rate limits gracefully
- Provide clear error messages
- DM user for sensitive info (like `/link` URL)

### Hybrid Architecture
- Bot is centralized (you run one instance)
- Nodes are distributed (server operators run their own)
- Bot queries node APIs via HTTP
- API keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- Health checks run automatically every 5 minutes
- HTTPS required for all node API URLs

## 🗂️ Old Architecture (Deprecated)

The original centralized architecture with React frontend, PostgreSQL, and Redis has been **deprecated** in favor of the hybrid distributed POC.

Old code remains in the repo but should not be extended. Focus all new development on the `bot/` and `node/` directories.

---

## 🎉 Current Implementation Status

- ✅ **Bot:** Central Discord bot with node registry
- ✅ **Node:** HTTP API with session tracking and log parsing
- ✅ **Commands:** `/register-node`, `/node-status`, `/help`
- ✅ **API:** Health, stats, session, reputation endpoints
- ✅ **Security:** API key authentication and encryption
- ✅ **Documentation:** Comprehensive setup guides

### What's Next
- 🔄 **Phase 3:** Steam OAuth integration for user linking
- 🔄 **Phase 4:** Voting system with proof of presence
- 🔄 **Phase 5:** Node-to-node vote replication

### How to Get Started
1. **Setup Bot:** See `docs/HYBRID_SETUP.md` Part 1
2. **Setup Node:** See `docs/HYBRID_SETUP.md` Part 2
3. **Register Node:** Use `/register-node` command in Discord
4. **Test Integration:** Use `/node-status` to verify connection
